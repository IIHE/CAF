Some information on CAF tests.

Currently, only CAF::FileWriter and CAF::Process have test
batteries. Please feel free to add your own, and perhaps to adapt this
document to your needs.

We are not interested on seeing CAF::FileWriter writing files or
CAF::Process running commands. That task is delegated on LC::*
modules, so the only interest of these tests is to ensure that such
modules are correctly invoked and the log (verbose) messages are
consistent.

To make it easier to test, some fake LC:: modules are provided. See
their documentation.

In general, it's easier to add your own backup modules for anything
that is not CAF. Those modules should be trivial and allow for direct
checking of the results (with no need to be root to execute them, for
instance).

All tests in this directory work directly with the Perl modules on CVS
(those on ../CAF). There is no need to build an RPM and install it.
