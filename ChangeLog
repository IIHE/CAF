2008-11-15  <unknown>

	* Release: 1.7.3
	- Adding messages to CAF::FileWriter telling if the file was actually modified.

2008-11-14  <unknown>

	* Release: 1.7.2
	- Documentation update on CAF::FileWriter

2008-10-21  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.7.1
	- Fixed bug #43116
	
	There was a call to _REP_SETUP->report instead of $self->report on the debug method.
	Also, ReporterMany blindly overwrote the settings from CAF::Reporter, leading to --verbose
	and --debug not working.

2008-09-30  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.7.0
	- New module, CAF::FileWriter, for wrapping file writing operations.
	It provides a file-like interface, but doesn't actually write to a file
	if the contents don't change. It uses LC::Check for that, so it doesn't
	respect SELinux contexts.
	
	Added tests for CAF::FileWriter and updated the tests for CAF::Process.
	
	Added a run-all-tests script, for being able to run all tests with the
	make test command.
	
	Renamed the "test" directory to "t", to comply with the build toolds
	requirements.

2008-09-29  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.6.7
	- Updated CAF::ReporterMany's documentation.

2008-09-26  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.6.6
	- Removed the CAF::FileWriter module from the Makefile.

2008-09-26  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.6.5
	- Temporarily removing the CAF::FileWriter module, to have a version that doesn't
	require perl-IO-String and yet has a working CAF::ReporterMany.

2008-09-26  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.6.4
	- Tagging the previous change.

2008-09-26  Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías  <mejias@delta.ft.uam.es>

	* Release: 1.6.4
	- CAF::ReporterMany: fixed the setup_reporter method to fetch, at
	the beginning, the global settings of CAF::Reporter.

2008-09-26  Marco Emilio Poleggi,<Marco.Poleggi@cnaf.infn.it>

	* Release: 1.6.3

	- CAF::RepLogger updated to use CAF::ReporterMany

2008-09-18  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.6.2
	- Added CAF::Process. CVS sucks.

2008-09-17  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.6.0
	- Added a new module, Process.pm, which wraps LC::Process and allows to log the commands
	run, at the verbose level. See the man page for more information.

2008-08-05  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.5.3
	- Fixed Reporter.pm causing processes to die when the syslog daemon is not running
	and the log sockets are not available (f.i., when installing OpenVZ guests)

	* Release: 1.5.2
	- Fixed a priority name

2008-07-31  "Luis Fernando"

2008-07-28  "Luis Fernando"

	* Release: 1.5.0
	- Adding the ability to log to syslog, as well as old-style logs.
	Note that the CAF::Reporter::syslog method is not thread-safe.

2007-12-06  Marco Emilio Poleggi,<Marco.Poleggi@cern.ch>

	* Release: 1.4.15
	- Object: inherits from Reporter and initializes it new() to avoid issues
	with application which are already using CAF::Reporter.

2007-12-05  Marco Emilio Poleggi,<Marco.Poleggi@cern.ch>

	* Release: 1.4.14
